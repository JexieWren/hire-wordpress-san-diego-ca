## Configuring WordPress as a Headless CMS

### Enabling the REST API

To expose WordPress content via an API, it's crucial to enable the REST API. Add the following line to your WordPress config file:

```php
define('REST_API_ENABLED', true);
```

This makes API endpoints available under the /wp-json/* path.

### Setting Custom Capabilities

The default capabilities of the REST API may be too permissive. Set custom capabilities to restrict access using code like:

```php
'read_posts' => 'read',
'edit_posts' => 'edit_posts'
```

This ensures that only users with the correct role can access specific API responses.

### Securing with JWT Authentication

Implement JSON Web Tokens (JWT) for stateless authentication of the API. Install and configure a JWT plugin to securely authenticate requests from the Angular app.

### Registering Custom Post Types

Expose custom content types such as "Projects" or "Team" using code like:

```php
register_post_type(
   'project', 
   array('show_in_rest' => true)
);
```

This makes the "project" post type available via the API.

### Enable Taxonomies

Allow filtering posts by tags or categories by registering taxonomies:

```php 
'rewrite' => ['slug' => 'projects/tags'],
'show_in_rest' => true
```

This prepares a canonical headless WordPress installation for consumption by JavaScript frameworks.

## Creating the Angular App

### Setting up an Angular Universal Project

To leverage server-side rendering, create a project configured for Angular Universal:

```bash
ng new project-name --universal
```

This sets up the necessary build tools, files, and dependencies.

### Structuring Feature Modules

Organize related components into feature modules such as:

```bash
ng g module Projects 
ng g module Home
``` 

Each module handles a specific section of the site for scalability.

### Defining Routes and Components

Routes direct Universal to components for pre-rendering:

```typescript
const routes: Routes = [
  { 
    path: 'projects',
    component: ProjectsComponent
  }
];
```

### Installing Libraries

Install Angular dependencies:

```bash
npm i @angular/common/http 
npm i @ng-universal/express-engine
```

These dependencies enable data fetching from the WP API and integration with server-side rendering.

### Configuring Lazy Loading

Lazy load non-critical modules for faster loading using features like `loadChildren`.

This establishes an optimized Angular structure to interface with the decoupled WordPress API through universal rendering.

## Fetching Data from WordPress API

### Making API Requests from Services

Create a `DataService` to encapsulate API calls using HttpClient:

```typescript
@Injectable()
export class DataService {

  constructor(private http: HttpClient) {}

  getPosts() {
    return this.http.get<Post[]>('http://example.com/wp-json/wp/v2/posts'); 
  }

}
```

Inject this service into components to leverage the WP REST API.

### Adding Request Parameters

Enhance API calls with parameters such as pagination and filters:

```typescript
getPosts(page: number) {
  return this.http.get<Post[]>(
    'http://example.com/wp-json/wp/v2/posts', 
    {params: {per_page: 10, page}}
  );
}  
```

### Handling API Errors

Implement graceful error handling for failed requests:

```typescript
getPosts() {
  return this.http.get<Post[]>('/api/posts')
    .pipe(
      catchError(this.handleError)
    );
}

private handleError(error: HttpErrorResponse) {
  // Log error or display user-friendly message
} 
```

This synchronization ensures remote WordPress content is seamlessly integrated into the client app.

## Pre-Rendering Strategies

### Server-Side Rendering

Universal renders components on the server first, inserting initial HTML and loading JavaScript separately:

```typescript
app.engine

('html', ngExpressEngine({
  bootstrap: AppServerModule 
}));
```

### Prerendering with CLI 

The CLI renders bundles during builds using `ng run <project>:prerender`. 

### Prerendering on Build

Tools like `angular-builder-prerenderer` generate static HTML for crawler indexing on production builds.

### Incremental Prerendering

Render only changed pages to skip statically rendered routes. Use this with a headless Chrome instance to selectively re-generate:

```bash
chrome --disable-gpu --headless --remote-debugging-port=9222 
```

Monitor API/database for changes and trigger re-rendering of impacted pages through the debug port.

This combination optimizes server-side rendering for initial page loads with strategies to pregenerate search-engine optimized content for improved SEO and performance.

## Optimization Techniques

### Code Splitting with Webpack

Utilize Webpack's `SplitChunksPlugin` to split code into smaller bundles and only load what's needed per route:

```js
optimization: {
  splitChunks: {
    chunks: 'all'
  }
}
```

### Lazy Loading Features

Lazy load non-critical modules by adding a `loadChildren` path to the router:

```ts
{
  path: 'reports', 
  loadChildren: './reports/reports.module#ReportsModule'
}
```

### Minification and Bundling

Minify and optimize bundles for production using `ng build --prod` which includes minification, uglification, and scope hoisting.

### Caching Strategies 

Implement output hash filenames, set long cache times for static assets, integrate a CDN, and add cache-control headers to leverage browser caching for performance.

Configure the Angular production build for optimal performance by reducing bundle sizes and leveraging the browser cache through techniques like code splitting and lazy loading.

## Deployment Workflow

### Building and Rendering Bundles

Run the build to generate static bundles:  

```bash
ng build --prod
```

Render bundles on the server for pre-rendering:

```bash
npm run build:ssr && npm run render
```

### Deploying to Production  

Deploy the Universal app and rendered static files to a Node host like AWS/Heroku.

### Setting up CDNs

Configure a CDN like Cloudflare or Akamai to cache and serve assets from the fastest edge locations.

### Monitoring Performance

Use tools like Google Lighthouse, GTmetrix, and Web Vitals to audit site speed, SEO, and UX over time as traffic grows. 

Integrate monitoring for server requests and errors.

This workflow optimizes the build process, leverages the benefits of CDNs, and allows ongoing performance tracking as the app scales. Proper monitoring is essential to measure improvements from deployment refinements.
